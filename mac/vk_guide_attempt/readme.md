## (1) Messed around for a few hours to no avail at first 
## (2) After working in another tutorial for 6 hours came back and got the basic SDL window working

# Versioning

## (chapter-1) = basic vulkan logic but nothing works 
## (chapter-1b) = through the end of chapter 1, working visual rendering flashing blue light
