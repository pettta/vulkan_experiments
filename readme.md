# Tried to mess around with https://vkguide.dev/ 

- Doesn't play super nicefully with mac if you aren't already super familiar with vulkan
- Comes with a bunch of files, but hard to debug the cmake issues imo with so many files just to start 
- Tried to get it to work for about 5 hours than gave up and went to a different tutorial, will come back to it later 

# Then I went to try out https://vulkan-tutorial.com/
- Uses GLFW rather than SDL for the window 
- much longer and more explained beginnings but doesn't get as far 

# Requirements For Mac
- VulkanSDK==1.4.304.0
